# SolarSystemSimulator
#### Web application created with Angular and Three.js library that allows you to simulate motion of the planets in The Solar System in two seperate modes - manipulating speed of the simulation or choosing specific date. You can also check information about each planet by clicking on it. 

The only requirements for the application to work properly is for the browser to be able to generate at least 60 frames per second.

Application is available in Polish and English language at https://bs-solar-system.netlify.app/
